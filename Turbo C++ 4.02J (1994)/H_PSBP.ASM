; * removal of RULES.ASI to eliminate redundancy
; * removal of the 'CODE' segment declaration (for obvious reasons)

;       ax:dx   left hand pointer
;       bx:cx   right hand pointer
;
;               To subtract, first convert both pointers to longs.
;               then do a simple signed long subtraction.  Actually
;               we only store 24 bit ints until the subtraction is
;               done.
