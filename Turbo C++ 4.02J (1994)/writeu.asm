; *Not* the original file, but an edit to turn it into an includable slice.
; Changes include:
; * removal of RULES.ASI to eliminate redundancy
; * removal of the 'CODE' segment declaration (for obvious reasons)
; * removal of external function references (and subsequent correction of
;   their symbols in the code)
